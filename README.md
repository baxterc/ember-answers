# EmberAnswers

#### Where you go when you don't know! A project for Epicodus, 8/19/2016

#### By Charlie Baxter

## Description
This app is a question-and-answer forum using Ember, similar to services like Yahoo Answers or Ask.fm.  Users can submit questions, which can then be answered.  Answers can be upvoted and downvoted with the score displayed alongside the answer.  Questions have a one-to-many relation with answers using a Firebase datastore; if a question is deleted, its answers are correctly deleted.
